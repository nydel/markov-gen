From childhoods hour I have not been As others were I have not seen As others saw I could not bring My passions from a common spring From the same source I have not taken My sorrowI could not awaken My heart to joy at the same tone And all I loved I loved alone Thenin my childhoodin the dawn Of a most stormy lifewas drawn From evry depth of good and ill The mystery which binds me still From the torrent or the fountain From the red cliff of the mountain From the sun that around me rolled In its autumn tint of gold From the lightning in the sky As it passd me flying by From the thunder and the storm And the cloud that took the form When the rest of Heaven was blue Of a demon in my view In visions of the dark night I have dreamed of joy departed But a waking dream of life and light Hath left me broken hearted Ah what is not a dream by day To him whose eyes are cast On things around him with a ray Turned back upon the past That holy dreamthat holy dream While all the world were chiding Hath cheered me as a lovely beam A lonely spirit guiding What though that light thro storm and night So trembled from afar What could there be more purely bright In Truths day star Take this kiss upon the brow And in parting from you now Thus much let me avow You are not wrong who deem That my days have been a dream Yet if hope has flown away In a night or in a day In a vision or in none Is it therefore the less gone All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream I stand amid the roar Of a surf tormented shore And I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand How few yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep While I weep while I weep O God Can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp O God can I not save One from the pitiless wave Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream It was many and many a year ago In a kingdom by the sea That a maiden there lived whom you may know By the name of Annabel Lee And this maiden she lived with no other thought Than to love and be loved by me I was a child and she was a child In this kingdom by the sea But we loved with a love that was more than love I and my Annabel Lee With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven Coveted her and me And this was the reason that long ago In this kingdom by the sea A wind blew out of a cloud chilling My beautiful Annabel Lee So that her highborn kinsmen came And bore her away from me To shut her up in a sepulchre In this kingdom by the sea The angels not half so happy in Heaven Went envying her and me Yesthat was the reason as all men know In this kingdom by the sea That the wind came out of the cloud by night Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee But our love it was stronger by far than the love Of those who were older than we Of many far wiser than we And neither the angels in Heaven above Nor the demons down under the sea Can ever dissever my soul from the soul Of the beautiful Annabel Lee For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams Of the beautiful Annabel Lee And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes Of the beautiful Annabel Lee And so all the night tide I lie down by the side Of my darlingmy darlingmy life and my bride In her sepulchre there by the sea In her tomb by the sounding sea By a route obscure and lonely Haunted by ill angels only Where an Eidolon named NIGHT On a black throne reigns upright I have reached these lands but newly From an ultimate dim Thule From a wild weird clime that lieth sublime Out of SPACEOut of TIME Bottomless vales and boundless floods And chasms and caves and Titan woods With forms that no man can discover For the tears that drip all over Mountains toppling evermore Into seas without a shore Seas that restlessly aspire Surging unto skies of fire Lakes that endlessly outspread Their lone waterslone and dead Their still watersstill and chilly With the snows of the lolling lily By the lakes that thus outspread Their lone waters lone and dead Their sad waters sad and chilly With the snows of the lolling lily By the mountainsnear the river Murmuring lowly murmuring ever By the grey woodsby the swamp Where the toad and the newt encamp By the dismal tarns and pools Where dwell the Ghouls By each spot the most unholy In each nook most melancholy There the traveller meets aghast Sheeted Memories of the Past Shrouded forms that start and sigh As they pass the wanderer by White robed forms of friends long given In agony to the Earthand Heaven For the heart whose woes are legion T is a peaceful soothing region For the spirit that walks in shadow T isoh t is an Eldorado But the traveller travelling through it May notdare not openly view it Never its mysteries are exposed To the weak human eye unclosed So wills its King who hath forbid The uplifting of the fringd lid And thus the sad Soul that here passes Beholds it but through darkened glasses By a route obscure and lonely Haunted by ill angels only Where an Eidolon named NIGHT On a black throne reigns upright I have wandered home but newly From this ultimate dim Thule Gaily bedight A gallant knight In sunshine and in shadow Had journeyed long Singing a song In search of Eldorado But he grew old This knight so bold And over his heart a shadow Fell as he found No spot of ground That looked like Eldorado And as his strength Failed him at length He met a pilgrim shadow Shadow said he Where can it be This land of Eldorado Over the Mountains Of the Moon Down the Valley of the Shadow Ride boldly ride The shade replied If you seek for Eldorado Dim valesand shadowy floods And cloudy looking woods Whose forms we cant discover For the tears that drip all over Huge moons there wax and wane Againagainagain Every moment of the night Forever changing places And they put out the star light With the breath from their pale faces About twelve by the moon dial One more filmy than the rest A kind which upon trial They have found to be the best Comes downstill downand down With its centre on the crown Of a mountains eminence While its wide circumference In easy drapery falls Over hamlets over halls Wherever they may be Oer the strange woodsoer the sea Over spirits on the wing Over every drowsy thing And buries them up quite In a labyrinth of light And then how deep O deep Is the passion of their sleep In the morning they arise And their moony covering Is soaring in the skies With the tempests as they toss Likealmost any thing Or a yellow Albatross They use that moon no more For the same end as before Videlicet a tent Which I think extravagant Its atomies however Into a shower dissever Of which those butterflies Of Earth who seek the skies And so come down again Never contented things Have brought a specimen Upon their quivering wings Thank Heaven the crisis The danger is past And the lingering illness Is over at last And the fever called Living Is conquered at last Sadly I know I am shorn of my strength And no muscle I move As I lie at full length But no matterI feel I am better at length And I rest so composedly Now in my bed That any beholder Might fancy me dead Might start at beholding me Thinking me dead The moaning and groaning The sighing and sobbing Are quieted now With that horrible throbbing At heartah that horrible Horrible throbbing The sicknessthe nausea The pitiless pain Have ceased with the fever That maddened my brain With the fever called Living That burned in my brain And oh of all tortures That torture the worst Has abatedthe terrible Torture of thirst For the naphthaline river Of Passion accurst I have drank of a water That quenches all thirst Of a water that flows With a lullaby sound From a spring but a very few Feet under ground From a cavern not very far Down under ground And ah let it never Be foolishly said That my room it is gloomy And narrow my bed For man never slept In a different bed And to sleep you must slumber In just such a bed My tantalized spirit Here blandly reposes Forgetting or never Regretting its roses Its old agitations Of myrtles and roses For now while so quietly Lying it fancies A holier odor About it of pansies A rosemary odor Commingled with pansies With rue and the beautiful Puritan pansies And so it lies happily Bathing in many A dream of the truth And the beauty of Annie Drowned in a bath Of the tresses of Annie She tenderly kissed me She fondly caressed And then I fell gently To sleep on her breast Deeply to sleep From the heaven of her breast When the light was extinguished She covered me warm And she prayed to the angels To keep me from harm To the queen of the angels To shield me from harm And I lie so composedly Now in my bed Knowing her love That you fancy me dead And I rest so contentedly Now in my bed With her love at my breast That you fancy me dead That you shudder to look at me Thinking me dead But my heart it is brighter Than all of the many Stars in the sky For it sparkles with Annie It glows with the light Of the love of my Annie With the thought of the light Of the eyes of my Annie In Heaven a spirit doth dwell Whose heart strings are a lute None sing so wildly well As the angel Israfel And the giddy stars so legends tell Ceasing their hymns attend the spell Of his voice all mute Tottering above In her highest noon The enamoured moon Blushes with love While to listen the red levin With the rapid Pleiads even Which were seven Pauses in Heaven And they say the starry choir And the other listening things That Israfelis fire Is owing to that lyre By which he sits and sings The trembling living wire Of those unusual strings But the skies that angel trod Where deep thoughts are a duty Where Loves a grown up God Where the Houri glances are Imbued with all the beauty Which we worship in a star Therefore thou art not wrong Israfeli who despisest An unimpassioned song To thee the laurels belong Best bard because the wisest Merrily live and long The ecstasies above With thy burning measures suit Thy grief thy joy thy hate thy love With the fervour of thy lute Well may the stars be mute Yes Heaven is thine but this Is a world of sweets and sours Our flowers are merelyflowers And the shadow of thy perfect bliss Is the sunshine of ours If I could dwell Where Israfel Hath dwelt and he where I He might not sing so wildly well A mortal melody While a bolder note than this might swell From my lyre within the sky Romance who loves to nod and sing With drowsy head and folded wing Among the green leaves as they shake Far down within some shadowy lake To me a painted paroquet Hath beena most familiar bird Taught me my alphabet to say To lisp my very earliest word While in the wild wood I did lie A childwith a most knowing eye Of late eternal Condor years So shake the very Heaven on high With tumult as they thunder by I have no time for idle cares Through gazing on the unquiet sky And when an hour with calmer wings Its down upon my spirit flings That little time with lyre and rhyme To while awayforbidden things My heart would feel to be a crime Unless it trembled with the strings Science true daughter of Old Time thou art Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes Why preyest thou thus upon the poets heart Vulture whose wings are dull realities How should he love thee or how deem thee wise Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car And driven the Hamadryad from the wood To seek a shelter in some happier star Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood The Elfin from the green grass and from me The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree Thy soul shall find itself alone Mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone Not one of all the crowd to pry Into thine hour of secrecy Be silent in that solitude Which is not lonelinessfor then The spirits of the dead who stood In life before thee are again In death around theeand their will Shall overshadow thee be still The night tho clear shall frown And the stars shall look not down From their high thrones in the heaven With light like Hope to mortals given But their red orbs without beam To thy weariness shall seem As a burning and a fever Which would cling to thee for ever Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish Now are visions neer to vanish From thy spirit shall they pass No morelike dew drop from the grass The breezethe breath of Godis still And the mist upon the hill Shadowyshadowyyet unbroken Is a symbol and a token How it hangs upon the trees A mystery of mysteries Lo t is a gala night Within the lonesome latter years An angel throng bewinged bedight In veils and drowned in tears Sit in a theatre to see A play of hopes and fears While the orchestra breathes fitfully The music of the spheres Mimes in the form of God on high Mutter and mumble low And hither and thither fly Mere puppets they who come and go At bidding of vast formless things That shift the scenery to and fro Flapping from out their Condor wings Invisible Wo That motley dramaoh be sure It shall not be forgot With its Phantom chased for evermore By a crowd that seize it not Through a circle that ever returneth in To the self same spot And much of Madness and more of Sin And Horror the soul of the plot But see amid the mimic rout A crawling shape intrude A blood red thing that writhes from out The scenic solitude It writhesit writheswith mortal pangs The mimes become its food And seraphs sob at vermin fangs In human gore imbued Outout are the lightsout all And over each quivering form The curtain a funeral pall Comes down with the rush of a storm While the angels all pallid and wan Uprising unveiling affirm That the play is the tragedy Man And its hero the Conqueror Worm In the greenest of our valleys By good angels tenanted Once a fair and stately palace Radiant palacereared its head In the monarch Thoughts dominion It stood there Never seraph spread a pinion Over fabric half so fair Banners yellow glorious golden On its roof did float and flow Thisall thiswas in the olden Time long ago And every gentle air that dallied In that sweet day Along the ramparts plumed and pallid A wingèd odor went away Wanderers in that happy valley Through two luminous windows saw Spirits moving musically To a lutes well tunèd law Round about a throne where sitting Porphyrogene In state his glory well befitting The ruler of the realm was seen And all with pearl and ruby glowing Was the fair palace door Through which came flowing flowing flowing And sparkling evermore A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty Was but to sing In voices of surpassing beauty The wit and wisdom of their king But evil things in robes of sorrow Assailed the monarchs high estate Ah let us mournfor never morrow Shall dawn upon him desolate And round about his home the glory That blushed and bloomed Is but a dim remembered story Of the old time entombed And travellers now within that valley Through the red litten windows see Vast forms that move fantastically To a discordant melody While like a ghastly rapid river Through the pale door A hideous throng rush out forever And laughbut smile no more Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered weak and weary Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore While I nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping As of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door Tis some visitor I muttered tapping at my chamber door Only this and nothing more Ah distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor Eagerly I wished the morrowvainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost Lenore For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore Nameless here for evermore And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before So that now to still the beating of my heart I stood repeating Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door This it is and nothing more Presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer Sir said I or Madam truly your forgiveness I implore But the fact is I was napping and so gently you came rapping And so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door That I scarce was sure I heard youhere I opened wide the door Darkness there and nothing more Deep into that darkness peering long I stood there wondering fearing Doubting dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before But the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token And the only word there spoken was the whispered word Lenore This I whispered and an echo murmured back the word Lenore Merely this and nothing more Back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before Surely said I surely that is something at my window lattice Let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore Tis the wind and nothing more Open here I flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore Not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he But with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door Perched and sat and nothing more Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore Though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou I said art sure no craven Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Nights Plutonian shore Quoth the Raven Nevermore Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly Though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door With such name as Nevermore But the Raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only That one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour Nothing farther then he utterednot a feather then he fluttered Till I scarcely more than muttered Other friends have flown before On the morrow he will leave me as my Hopes have flown before Then the bird said Nevermore Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken Doubtless said I what it utters is its only stock and store Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore Of Nevernevermore But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door Then upon the velvet sinking I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore What this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore Meant in croaking Nevermore This I sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core This and more I sat divining with my head at ease reclining On the cushions velvet lining that the lamp light gloated oer But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp light gloating oer She shall press ah nevermore Then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by Seraphim whose foot falls tinkled on the tufted floor Wretch I cried thy God hath lent theeby these angels he hath sent thee Respiterespite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore Quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore Quoth the Raven Nevermore Prophet said I thing of evilprophet still if bird or devil Whether Tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore Desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted On this home by Horror hauntedtell me truly I implore Is thereis there balm in Gileadtell metell me I implore Quoth the Raven Nevermore Prophet said I thing of evilprophet still if bird or devil By that Heaven that bends above usby that God we both adore Tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant Aidenn It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore Quoth the Raven Nevermore Be that word our sign of parting bird or fiend I shrieked upstarting Get thee back into the tempest and the Nights Plutonian shore Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken Leave my loneliness unbrokenquit the bust above my door Take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door Quoth the Raven Nevermore And the Raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door And his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming And the lamp light over him streaming throws his shadow on the floor And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor Shall be liftednevermore At midnight in the month of June I stand beneath the mystic moon An opiate vapor dewy dim Exhales from out her golden rim And softly dripping drop by drop Upon the quiet mountain top Steals drowsily and musically Into the universal valley The rosemary nods upon the grave The lily lolls upon the wave Wrapping the fog about its breast The ruin moulders into rest Looking like Lethe see the lake A conscious slumber seems to take And would not for the world awake All Beauty sleepsand lo where lies Irene with her Destinies Oh lady bright can it be right This window open to the night The wanton airs from the tree top Laughingly through the lattice drop The bodiless airs a wizard rout Flit through thy chamber in and out And wave the curtain canopy So fitfullyso fearfully Above the closed and fringéd lid Neath which thy slumbring soul lies hid That over the floor and down the wall Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall Oh lady dear hast thou no fear Why and what art thou dreaming here Sure thou art come over far off seas A wonder to these garden trees Strange is thy pallor strange thy dress Strange above all thy length of tress And this all solemn silentness The lady sleeps Oh may her sleep Which is enduring so be deep Heaven have her in its sacred keep This chamber changed for one more holy This bed for one more melancholy I pray to God that she may lie Forever with unopened eye While the pale sheeted ghosts go by My love she sleeps Oh may her sleep As it is lasting so be deep Soft may the worms about her creep Far in the forest dim and old For her may some tall vault unfold Some vault that oft hath flung its black And wingéd pannels fluttering back Triumphant over the crested palls Of her grand family funerals Some sepulchre remote alone Against whose portals she hath thrown In childhood many an idle stone Some tomb from out whose sounding door She neer shall force an echo more Thrilling to think poor child of sin It was the dead who groaned within  Once it smiled a silent dell Where the people did not dwell They had gone unto the wars Trusting to the mild eyed stars Nightly from their azure towers To keep watch above the flowers In the midst of which all day The red sun light lazily lay Now each visitor shall confess The sad valleys restlessness Nothing there is motionless Nothing save the airs that brood Over the magic solitude Ah by no wind are stirred those trees That palpitate like the chill seas Around the misty Hebrides Ah by no wind those clouds are driven That rustle through the unquiet Heaven Uneasily from morn till even Over the violets there that lie In myriad types of the human eye Over the lilies there that wave And weep above a nameless grave They wavefrom out their fragrant tops External dews come down in drops They weepfrom off their delicate stems Perennial tears descend in gems The skies they were ashen and sober The leaves they were crisped and sere The leaves they were withering and sere It was night in the lonesome October Of my most immemorial year It was hard by the dim lake of Auber In the misty mid region of Weir It was down by the dank tarn of Auber In the ghoul haunted woodland of Weir Here once through an alley Titanic Of cypress I roamed with my Soul Of cypress with Psyche my Soul These were days when my heart was volcanic As the scoriac rivers that roll As the lavas that restlessly roll Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek In the ultimate climes of the pole That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek In the realms of the boreal pole Our talk had been serious and sober But our thoughts they were palsied and sere Our memories were treacherous and sere For we knew not the month was October And we marked not the night of the year Ah night of all nights in the year We noted not the dim lake of Auber Though once we had journeyed down here We remembered not the dank tarn of Auber Nor the ghoul haunted woodland of Weir And now as the night was senescent And star dials pointed to morn As the star dials hinted of morn At the end of our path a liquescent And nebulous lustre was born Out of which a miraculous crescent Arose with a duplicate horn Astartes bediamonded crescent Distinct with its duplicate horn And I saidShe is warmer than Dian She rolls through an ether of sighs She revels in a region of sighs She has seen that the tears are not dry on These cheeks where the worm never dies And has come past the stars of the Lion To point us the path to the skies To the Lethean peace of the skies Come up in despite of the Lion To shine on us with her bright eyes Come up through the lair of the Lion With love in her luminous eyes But Psyche uplifting her finger SaidSadly this star I mistrust Her pallor I strangely mistrust Oh hasten oh let us not linger Oh flylet us flyfor we must In terror she spoke letting sink her Wings till they trailed in the dust In agony sobbed letting sink her Plumes till they trailed in the dust Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust I repliedThis is nothing but dreaming Let us on by this tremulous light Let us bathe in this crystalline light Its Sybilic splendor is beaming With Hope and in Beauty to night Seeit flickers up the sky through the night Ah we safely may trust to its gleaming And be sure it will lead us aright We safely may trust to a gleaming That cannot but guide us aright Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her And tempted her out of her gloom And conquered her scruples and gloom And we passed to the end of the vista But were stopped by the door of a tomb By the door of a legended tomb And I saidWhat is written sweet sister On the door of this legended tomb She repliedUlalumeUlalume Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume Then my heart it grew ashen and sober As the leaves that were crispèd and sere As the leaves that were withering and sere And I criedIt was surely October On this very night of last year That I journeyedI journeyed down here That I brought a dread burden down here On this night of all nights in the year Oh what demon has tempted me here Well I know now this dim lake of Auber This misty mid region of Weir Well I know now this dank tarn of Auber In the ghoul haunted woodland of Weir Said we then the two then Ah can it Have been that the woodlandish ghouls The pitiful the merciful ghouls To bar up our way and to ban it From the secret that lies in these wolds From the thing that lies hidden in these wolds Had drawn up the spectre of a planet From the limbo of lunary souls This sinfully scintillant planet From the Hell of the planetary souls Helen thy beauty is to me Like those Nicéan barks of yore That gently over a perfumed sea The weary way worn wanderer bore To his own native shore On desperate seas long wont to roam Thy hyacinth hair thy classic face Thy Naiad airs have brought me home To the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome Lo in yon brilliant window niche How statue like I see thee stand The agate lamp within thy hand Ah Psyche from the regions which Are Holy Land Because I feel that in the Heavens above The angels whispering to one another Can find among their burning terms of love None so devotional as that of Mother Therefore by that dear name I long have called you You who are more than mother unto me And fill my heart of hearts where Death installed you In setting my Virginias spirit free My mothermy own mother who died early Was but the mother of myself but you Are mother to the one I loved so dearly And thus are dearer than the mother I knew By that infinity with which my wife Was dearer to my soul than its soul life Thou wast that all to me love For which my soul did pine A green isle in the sea love A fountain and a shrine All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers And all the flowers were mine Ah dream too bright to last Ah starry Hope that didst arise But to be overcast A voice from out the Future cries On onbut over the Past Dim gulf my spirit hovering lies Mute motionless aghast For alas alas with me The light of Life is oer No moreno moreno more Such language holds the solemn sea To the sands upon the shore Shall bloom the thunder blasted tree Or the stricken eagle soar And all my days are trances And all my nightly dreams Are where thy grey eye glances And where thy footstep gleams In what ethereal dances By what eternal streams
