(period) and #\\, (comma) and #\\! (exclaimation point) ... it is most\r\n   likely okay to leave in #\\' (apostrophe) but why would you? once you have made the\r\n   string, run\r\n\r\n   (markov-gen:+eval-raw+ string)  ;; replacing \"string\" with either the string or a\r\n   symbol pointing to it. this will be create the markov association list and it will\r\n   be stored globally as markov-gen::*markov-raw-data*\r\n\r\n   once you have processed the data, you can generate new text:\r\n\r\n   (markov-gen:+gen-text+ first-word desired-length)\r\n\r\n   example of that:\r\n\r\n   (markov-gen:+gen-text+ \"the\" 250) ;; this will use your data to generate a string\r\n   of 250 words, unless it runs into a word that has no possible next words; so, of\r\n   course, it is best to use as lengthy of a string as possible for analysis, as this\r\n   will reduce the chance of running into an early end, especially when trying to\r\n   generate a very large amount of language, e.g. thousands of words.\r\n\r\n   so after interpretation, to test, you could use this string: actually,\r\n   i went ahead and stored what i wrote in markov-gen::*test-string*\r\n\r\n   to test using it do (markov-gen:+eval-raw+ markov-gen::*test-string*)\r\n               then do (markov-gen:+gen-text+ \"this\" 100)\r\n\r\n|#\r\n",
